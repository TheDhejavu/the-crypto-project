# The Crypto Project

This is a blockchain project that implements some of the major feature of popular cryptocurrency project like Bitcoin and ethereum using go programming language. This an experimental project for learning purposes and it contains detailed overview of how blockchain works, most importantly how this project works. You can checkout references to some major materials that plays important roles in making this project happen.

### Blockchain
Blockchain can be defined as a database that stores blocks, with every next block being linked to the previous one in a cryptographically secure way so that itâ€™s not possible to change anything in previous blocks, it is a Decentralized system of Nodes that works in a co-ordinated way.

The cryto-project blockchain has different actions which are made accessible via the in-built CLI and the REST API

### Consensus, Blocks & Proof Of Work (POW)

###  Wallet
The wallet system, comparable to a bank account, contains a pair of public and private cryptographic keys. The keys can be used to track ownership, receive or spend cryptocurrencies. A public key allows for other wallets to make payments to the wallet's address, whereas a private key enables the spending of cryptocurrency from that address.
#### NB: you can't spend your digital currency without your private key and once your private key is compromise, moving your money to a new wallet address is the best thing to do.


The wallet system is independent of the blockchain network and it is built ontop of the `chain` Command line(the network default CLI) and also there is a dedicated executable file in the `binaries` folder coupled with basic commands for performing different actions

##### Download https://github.com/TheDhejavu/the-crypto-project/tree/master/binaries/wallet.exe

#### Commands 

Generate new wallet

    ./wallet generate

Print all local wallet

    ./wallet print

Print wallet by Address

    ./wallet print --address ADDRESS

### Transactions


### Uspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Model

This concept became really popular due to the bitcoin blockhain and this can be defined as an output of a blockchain transaction that has not been spent

They are available to be used in new transactions (as long as you can unlock them with your private key), which makes them useful. UTXOs is used as inputs when a user tries to send X amount of token to Y person given that the amount of UTXOs that the user can unlock is enough to be used as an input. Calculating a wallet address balance can be gotten by accumulating all the unspent transaction outputs that are locked to the particular address
 #### Why do we need this ?
 
 Blockchain data are quite verbose, it can range from hundrends to billions of data and computing user wallet balance from a blockchian of that size is computationally expensive in which UTXOs came in as a resucue to reduce overhead. UTXOs ain't all that clever but it's a progress, Ethereum introduced a better way to compute user balance which i think is way better than UTXOs.

 ### How it works
 UTXos are stored on BadgerDB and specific commands were provided to handle this but Note, UTXos are created from the blockchain

### Merkle Tree

### Networking (P2P/Distributed System)

        help            Help about any command
        init            Initialize the blockchain and create the genesis block
        print           Print the blocks in the blockchain
        send            Send x amount of token to address from local
        wallet address
        startnode       start a node
        wallet          Manage wallets

    Flags:
